# *PROJECT NAME: DAAT Recipes* : *Project 3*



## Project Concept

The initaitaive coincides with the 2019 covid pandemic, which set the scene for people to able to make their restaurant favourite menu in their home and be creative about 
it due to the lockdown in most places globally.
Academically, the objective is to enable students to display the understanding of the topics learnt in the Data Centric Development module. 
The hands on experience achieved in the milestone project can be utilised in any workplace. 
Also provides in-depth exposure and knowledge of backend functionality CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Emphasis placed on ( python, Flask and Databases; Relational database (SQL) and NoSQL ( Mongo DB).

Benefits to me, I was able to understand how database works behind the scene, interacting python with Flask with MongoDB, 
the speed it offers in creating webpages using  the philosophy of “DRY”:  Don’t repeat yourself, 
 by using python route decorator , Jinja and template inheritance using the base html. 
 I have gained more knowledge to help me advance in my career as a web developer.

 ----------


 ## UX 
This project was developed with the User focus mind so that users can see how the system works 
especially where they can add recipe and view the recipe added when logged into their profile.


## User stories

I have used a persona to create user stories.
User Story (Persona: Barbara works as self employed as a cook.)

1.	As a cook, 
I should be able to create a profile, add my recipe to the page and send the link fans to check out my recipe.
    
   **Acceptance criteria**:Barbara should be able to click on the new recipe and add new recipe to the page and send link to fans page. 

User Story (Persona: Rose is a grocery shopper she needs to prepare her favourite menu and to get the ingredients from the store.)
   
2. As a grocery shopper,
I should be able to browse for my favourite recipe and click on the link to get the list of ingredients to be purchased in the next shopping.

 **Acceptance Criteria**:: Rose should be able to get list of ingredients from her selected favourite recipe and get the list of ingredients.   
 
User Story (Persona: General users, they can browse all recipes and select any method to use for their cooking.)

3.	As a general user,
I should be able to browse all the recipes and view the recipe ingredients and methods of my choice.

 **Acceptance Criteria**: General users should be able to browse all the recipes. view ingredients and methods of any recipe of their choice . 

 

### Wireframes

TMy wireframe was designed with Balsamic software tool and imported to PDF for viewing. 
The document can be found in the folder path named Wireframe.
The wire frame was designed based on my initial planning phase as a mock-up  to show the  basic functionality of  the webpage and end users interaction on different browsers .
The final product of the webpage it’s slightly different due to additional requirements along the design phase.  I have used Agile Methodology as part of my project management

# Features
----------------------------------

## Existing Features on the game board :
 * ON/OFF Switch toggle button : This enable users to interact with the gameboard
 initiate the game.
 * Four Colored Buttons : These are interactive buttons for users to press to play the game and see the effects of each button presses.
 * Start Button : This enable game player to start the game,a sound is heard to verify start button function.
 * Strict Button :Enable game player to  play in the strict mode, a check mark is displayed in the box to verify strict mode 
 is on and no check mark means users play in normal mode.
 * Count Button : This button displays the game player levels as they press the buttons to interact with the game 
 * Help Button ? These are PDF user manual to enable game player to understand how to play the game. 

    
## Features Left to Implement
  Due to time constraint on the project have not been priviledge to implement Certain features :
  Ideas to implement are :
  * Different levels of play mode : This will enable player to find it stimulating to build their memory strength.Such as 
    Normal and Easy mode.
  * Link to share game with friends on social media sites.
  * Further improvements to be made for responsiveness using media queries.
  

## Technologies Used
### Frameworks and libraries used in the project

[JavaScript:](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)The project is heavily based on JavaScript used to build the project.

[SemanticHTML:](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) The project uses HTML to write the code.

[CSS:](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) Used style the gameboard.

[Gitpod:](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) Workspace Editor for writing the code.

[Github:](https://github.com) It's used as repository for version control and commit update.

[Markdown:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template/master/README.md) Used to write ReadMe file.

[Jquery:](https://jquery.com/). Used to manupulate  the DOM elements.

[Balsamic:](https://balsamiq.com/) I have used this tool to design the interface of the game functionality.


## Testing
-----------------------------
See attached link for detailed manual testing.\
Automated testing would have been done, but my mentor said is not needed for my code.

[Manual Testing](https://github.com/daat2/play-simongame/blob/master/assets/images/manualTest-simon.pdf)

* The project was tested on the different devices [IOS,Android, desktop and Laptop].

* The test was conducted across two browsers- Firefox and Google Chrome. 

* Operating System used for testing : Windows 8 and Windows 10.

* I carried out User Acceptance test by sending link to friends to test the basic game functioanlity and feedback received.

* The part of the requirements for the test is based on the user stories in the UX header.

* The objective of the test is for players to be able to interact with the game.
