## Project Concept

The initaitaive coincides with the 2019 covid pandemic, which set the scene for people to able to make their restaurant favourite menu in their home and be creative about 
it due to the lockdown in most places globally.
Academically, the objective is to enable students to display the understanding of the topics learnt in the Data Centric Development module. 
The hands on experience achieved in the milestone project can be utilised in any workplace. 
Also provides in-depth exposure and knowledge of backend functionality CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Emphasis placed on ( python, Flask and Databases; Relational database (SQL) and NoSQL ( Mongo DB).

Benefits to me, I was able to understand how database works behind the scene, interacting python with Flask with MongoDB, 
the speed it offers in creating webpages using  the philosophy of “DRY”:  Don’t repeat yourself, 
 by using python route decorator , Jinja and template inheritance using the base html. 
 I have gained more knowledge to help me advance in my career as a web developer.



 ## UX 
This project was developed with the User focus mind so that users can see how the system functioanlity works 
especially where they can add recipe and view the recipe added when logged into their profile.


## User stories

*I have used  persona to create user stories.*

**User Story (Persona: Barbara works as self employed as a cook.)**

1.	As a cook, 
I should be able to create a profile, add my recipe to the page and send the link fans to check out my recipe.
    
*Acceptance criteria*:Barbara should be able to click on the new recipe and add new recipe to the page and send link to fans page. 

**User Story (Persona: Rose is a grocery shopper she needs to prepare her favourite menu and to get the ingredients from the store.)**
   
2. As a grocery shopper,
I should be able to browse for my favourite recipe and click on the link to get the list of ingredients to be purchased in the next shopping.

*Acceptance Criteria*:: Rose should be able to get list of ingredients from her selected favourite recipe and get the list of ingredients.   
 
**User Story (Persona: General users, they can browse all recipes and select any method to use for their cooking.)**

3.	As a general user,
I should be able to browse all the recipes and view the recipe ingredients and methods of my choice.

 *Acceptance Criteria*: General users should be able to browse all the recipes. view ingredients and methods of any recipe of their choice . 

 
### Wireframes

My wireframe was designed with Balsamic software tool and imported to PDF for viewing. 
The document can be found in the folder path named Wireframe.
The wireframe was initiative was based on my initial planning phase as a mock-up  to show the  basic functionality of  the webpage and end users interaction on different browsers .
The final product of the webpage it’s slightly different due to additional requirements along the design phase.  I have used Agile Methodology as part of my project management 
Click on the link to open the Wireframe.[**Wireframe DAAT Recipe**] (https://github.com/daat2/online-recipe-cookware/blob/master/static/wireframe/Recipe%20project%20wireframe1.pdf)

# Features

## Existing Features 
DAAT Recipe -Online-reipe-cookware :

 * Site Logo-I designed site logo as part of UX design so users can identify the brand as a recipe webpage.
 * Favicons- I created a favicon for my site, it is little icons displayed on the browser tab and bookmarks bar as an identity of my site so users can recognise the website..
 * Navbar- The Navbar comprises of all the navigation links which users will use to navigate through all the pages of the website
 * Secondary Navbar-  The secondary Navbar is a distinct Nav, user friendly easy access for users  to navigate through the Course meal and Cuisines of their choice.

 * Social media Link: Opens up social page for users to visit their social networks.

    
## Features Left to Implement
  
I am constrained by time and volume of the contents which limit my strength to provide more functionality for this project. 
If I was privileged and also something I will also implement as part of my work in progress in future, I   would implement the following ideas -

* Login By Email: Users should be able to login by email, which is easier for them to remember rather than Username.
* Share Recipe by Social Media and Email: To send recipe created to their email and share link with friends via email and social media network.
* Call To Actions:  Ability for users to be able to delete and update recipe created.
* Password Functionality:   User should   be able to change password and create a new on.
* Subscription: To subscribe to recipe news later and be able to post new recipes ideas on the page

See attached link for detailed manual testing.\
Automated testing would have been done, but my mentor said is not needed for my code.

[Manual Testing](https://github.com/daat2/play-simongame/blob/master/assets/images/manualTest-simon.pdf)

* The project was tested on the different devices [IOS,Android, desktop and Laptop].

* The test was conducted across two browsers- Firefox and Google Chrome. 

* Operating System used for testing : Windows 8 and Windows 10.

* I carried out User Acceptance test by sending link to friends to test the basic game functioanlity and feedback received.

* The part of the requirements for the test is based on the user stories in the UX header.

* The objective of the test is for players to be able to interact with the game.
